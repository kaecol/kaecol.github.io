In this study in collaboration with Prof. Thierry Azaïs from Sorbonne University in Paris, first author Dr. Harini Mohanram has explored the CaCO3 mineralization pathway regulated by the barnacle cement protein MrCP20. Harini has shown that MrCP20 stabilizes the metastable vaterite polymorphism of CaCO3. At the same time, during the mineralization process MrCP20 self-assembles into adhesive amyloid-like nanofibrils.

                   <p class="card-text">Our article “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1742706121006115" target='_blank'>Bioinspired short peptide hydrogel for versatile encapsulation and controlled release of growth factor therapeutics</a>” is published in Acta Biomaterialia. In this study conducted in collaboration with the teams of Prof. Dalton Tay (MSE) and Prof. Andrew Tan (LKC and SBS), first author and Senior Research Fellow Shu Hui Hiew has shown that the short GV8 peptide (only 8 amino acid long) can be used as a simple hydrogel system for controlled release of growth factor and stem cell sectrome mixtures for wound healing applications. GV8 hydrogel benefits from many advantages over other hydrogel systems used for similar wound healing and topical applications, including a simple on-pot gelation procedure and versatility to encapsulate and deliver macromolecular therapeutics. This peptide thus represents a promising biomaterial for regenerative medicine applications.

Inspired by the impact-resistant dactyl club of the stomatopod, Pezhman has rationally designed and synthesized a mineralized biocomposite exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness. This material is made of an expanded helicoidal organization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins that regulate both binding to CNCs and in situ growth of reinforcing apatite crystals.

                   <p class="card-text">Our paper, in collaboration with the labs of Prof. Yu Jing and Prof. Konstantin Pervushin, “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202103828" target='_blank'>Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation of the Green Mussel Adhesive Protein Pvfp-5 is Regulated by the Post-Translated Dopa Amino Acid</a>” is published in Advanced Materials. The study, with Dr. Deepankumar from BBML and PhD student Guo Qi from Prof. Yu Jing’s lab as co-first authors, demonstrates that in the green mussel adhesive protein Pvfp-5, modifying tyrosine amino acid residues into its post-translated version Dopa, enables self-coacervation (liquid-liquid phase separation, LLPS) of the protein. The main conclusion of this study is the suggestion that Dopa plays an important role in regulating LLPS of mussel adhesive proteins, which may be critical to concentrate the adhesive proteins at the plaque/substrate interface.

                   <p class="card-text">Our manuscript in collaboration with Prof. Konstantin Pervushin’s lab “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c11476" target='_blank'>Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation of Short Histidine-and Tyrosine-Rich Peptides: Sequence Specificity and Molecular Topology</a>” is published in a special issue of “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/page/jpcbfk/vsi/llps?ref=vi_journalhome#!" target='_blank'>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B” on Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS)</a>”. In this paper, first author and PhD student Jessica Lim has used short histidine and tyrosine-rich model peptides to precisely assess the roles of peptide motifs and single residues on the phase behavior of microdroplets obtained by LLPS. We have found that His and Tyr residues located near the sequence termini drive phase separation, forming interaction nodes that stabilize microdroplets. Combining quantum chemistry simulations with NMR studies, we also predict atomic-level bond geometries and uncover inter-residue supramolecular interactions governing LLPS. These results suggest that these phase-separating peptides are arranged into topological networks, which upon expansion form mesoscopic three-dimensional networks of microdroplets.

In this study, PhD student Dario Heyman and Dr. Harini Heyman have revealed the 3D structure of a chitin-binding domain (CBD-γ) located in a chitin-binding protein (CBP) from the beak of the jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas. This protein is one of four CBPs identified in the beak mouthpart of D. gigas and interacts with chitin to form a scaffold network that is infiltrated with a second set of structural proteins during beak maturation. We used solution state NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular interactions between CBD-γ and the soluble chitin derivative pentaacetyl-chitopentaose (PCP) and found that folding of CBD-γ is triggered by its interaction with PCP.

In this study, PhD student Isaiah Chua has conducted a micromechanics study of the dactyl club of mantis shrimps. He has used Focus Ion Beam (FIB) to machine microcantilever specimens with chevron-notched crack geometry to assess the fracture toughness. Adopting linear elastic and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics protocols, this study quantitatively demonstrates for the first time that plastic dissipation is the major contribution to the fracture response of the hypermineralized impact region of the dactyl club.

                   <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Publications</h6>
                   <p class="card-text">Our new paper on barnacle cement protein, “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c02319" target='_blank'>Disorder–Order Interplay of a Barnacle Cement Protein Triggered by Interactions with Calcium and Carbonate Ions: A Molecular Dynamics Study</a>”, is published in the ACS journal “<i>Chemistry of Materials</i>”. In this work, first author Akshita Kumar has conducted highly-detailed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to unveil the molecular-level interactions between the barnacle cement protein MrCP20 and calcium carbonate, both in ionic form and on solid surfaces. MrCP20 is one of the key protein in the barnacle cement that secures firm attachment of the animal to solid immersed surfaces, including minerals such as calcite. It has also previously been suggested to be involved in the biomineralization (calcification) of the protective barnacle shells but molecular details were previously unknown. Exploiting the 3D structure of MrCP20 previously elucidated in our lab, Akshita was able to precisely identify how MrCP20 captures calcium and carbonate ions around its surface, which is the first critical step towards protein-regulated biomineralization. She also identified the intermolecular interactions allowing MrCP20 to strongly and irreversibly adhere to calcified surfaces as calcite or hydroxyapatite. MrCP20 turns out to be a multifunctional protein of the barnacle cement that regulates biomineralization and contributes to the strong water-resistant adhesion of barnacles.

                   <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Publications</h6>
                   <p class="card-text">A few years ago, in a paper published in, “<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6352/668" target='_blank'>Science</a>”, we demonstrated that Slippery-Liquid Infused Surfaces (SLIPS) are remarkably efficient to prevent marine biofouling and unveiled the mechanisms by which marine mussels were deterred from attaching to such surfaces. Since then, we have established a collaboration with “<a href= “https://adaptivesurface.tech/” target='_blank'>Adaptive Surface Technology</a>”, a spin-off company who has been developing SLIPS coatings for various applications, including to combat marine biofouling. In our new publication “<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsapm.0c00916" target='_blank'>Laboratory and Field Testing Assessment of Next Generation Biocide-Free, Fouling-Resistant Slippery Coatings</a>”, published in the journal <i> ACS Applied Polymer Materials </i>, first-author Snehasish Basu from BBML has conducted a comprehensive study to assess the performance of AST coatings both in the lab and in the field. Using our in-house developed testing protocols, we have found that these coatings can perform at least as well as the lab-scale SLIPS versions. We also tested these coatings in the field in the highly aggressive fouling waters of Singapore. Fouling species, both soft biofilms as well as hard macrofoulers, could be easily detached from the surfaces, which has useful practical implications because it means much less labor-intensive procedures to clean up fouled surfaces. The work has also confirmed our previous fundamental findings established in lab-scale studies: the thickness of the lubricant overlayer is a critical design criterion that largely controls the fouling-release performance of SLIPPERY coatings.

                   <p class="card-text">Fouling organisms not only stick to immersed structures but can also cause serious corrosion damage. Barnacles in particular are well-known to corrode marine-grade steels, but so far the corrosion mechanism has remained elusive. In a joint collaboration with the lab of <a href=" https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/mseita/ " target='_blank'>Prof. Matteo Seita at MAE/NTU</a>, we have demonstrated that one of the main cement protein in the cement complex of barnacles (MrCP20) is redox-active and can directly oxidize iron. In our paper “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-020-0124" target='_blank'>Accelerated corrosion of marine-grade steel by a redox-active, cysteine-rich barnacle cement protein</a>”, published in "<i>npj Materials Degradation</i>", we have shown that di-sulfide bonds stabilizing MrCP20 are reduced upon adsorbing onto steel surfaces, thereby oxidizing metallic Fe into Fe ions. This mechanism, identified for the first time in a protein/metal interface, may have also be involved in protein-induced degradation of other metallic surfaces such as biomedical implants.

                   <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Publications</h6>
                   <p class="card-text"> Our publication “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S174270612030221X" target='_blank'>Magnetically responsive peptide coacervates for dual hyperthermia and chemotherapy treatments of liver cancer</a>” has been published in <i> “Acta Biomaterialia”</i>. Peptide coacervates derived from squid beak proteins (previously discovered in our lab) hold great potential to efficiently package various therapeutics and release them “on-demand” using an external stimulus or an internally-encoded trigger. In this work, Zhi Wei from BBML, in collaboration with the research team of Prof. Raju Ramanujan at NTU/MSE, has managed to recruit both the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) and iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) within the peptide coacervates. Using an external magnetic field, the MNPs induced localized heating within the droplets, in turn leading to their disassembly and to the release of the drugs. The concept was demonstrated in vitro on liver cancer cell lines: nearly 100% cell death could be induced by applying an external magnetic field. An exciting development was that the coacervates microdroplets could penetrate the cell membrane through an endocytosis-free pathway, opening the door to a wide range of intracellular drug release. Stay tuned for future developments in this direction!

                    <p class="card-text">Two new publications from the BBML were recently published. The article “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201907534" target='_blank'>Supramolecular &beta;-Sheet Suckerin–Based Underwater Adhesives</a>” appeared in “<i>Advanced Functional Materials</i>" and is the result of a collaboration with the labs of Dr. Bruno Zappone (Italian National Research Center and the University of Calabria) and Prof. Dong-Soo Hwang (POSTECH, South Korea). In this work, Deepankumar Kanagavel from BBML has developed artificial protein adhesives from squid sucker teeth proteins (SRTs) exhibiting outstanding water-resistant adhesive properties, and demonstrated that strong adhesion was due to supramolecular cross &beta;-sheet motifs. The other paper, "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979720301909?via%3Dihub">Green biolubricant infused slippery surfaces to combat marine biofouling</a>", by Snehasish Basu is in the area of marine biofouling and was published in the “<i>Journal of Colloids and Interface</i>”. In this study, which is a follow-up study of our previous article that appeared in “Science” two years ago, we have modified anti-fouling slippery coatings by replacing the silicon lubricant phase with the eco-friendly biolubricants oleic acid and methyl oleate that are harmless for the marine environment. In the lab, we have obtained a fouling-resistance performance nearly as equivalent as silicon-oil infused SLIPS coatings.

Prof. Konstantin Pervushin, and Prof Lars Nordenskiöld <b>have been awarded a Ministry of Education Tier 3 grant worth S$ 8.5 Million!</b> Ali Miserez is the lead PI of the project entitled <i>“Phase Separation-Regulated Life, In and Outside of Cells”</i>, which will tackle the exciting field of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). LLPS is a well-known phenomenon in colloidal chemistry and soft matter physics (known as coacervation), which has been “rejuvenated” in recent years with the realization that LLPS is widespread in biology. First demonstrated to play a critical role during the processing of functional extra-cellular materials such as biological adhesives, LLPS has since been observed in a plethora of intra-cellular phenomena, forming in particular membraneless organelles. In this project, we will seek to gain a fundamental understanding of molecular phenomena governing LLPS in systems such as actin self-assembly, in the carbon capture enzyme Rubisco, or in extra-cellular biological materials. We will heavily rely on quantitative biophysical characterization including solution and solid-state NMR or liquid-state TEM to understand the dynamics of droplets formation during LLPS. One thrust of the program will also seek to exploit LLPS for translation applications, notably in the area of smart delivery of therapeutics. Indeed, coacervate micro-droplets formed during LLPS exhibit the remarkable ability to recruit a wide range of both low and high molecular weight compounds, which can be released through external stimuli. We are extremely excited to work with this dynamic group of PIs. Post-doc and PhD opportunities will be available to work on this program and inquiries can addressed to Prof. Ali Miserez (<a href="mailto:ali.miserez@ntu.edu.sg">ali.miserez@ntu.edu.sg</a>).

In the article “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13469-8" target='_blank'>Hydrogen bond guidance and aromatic stacking drive liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered histidine-rich peptides</a>” first author Bartosz Gabryelczyk (now back at Aalto University in Finland) has revealed the key molecular mechanisms driving the Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of a family of Histidine-rich and Tyrosine-rich peptides from squid beak proteins. Using in particular mutagenesis and protein NMR, we have identified tandem repeats governing LLPS in this family of intrinsically-disordered peptides, and demonstrated that hydrogen bonding between Histidine and Tyrosine side-chains plays a critical role in the cascade leading to LLPS. In addition to fundamental understanding of molecular interactions driving LLPS, the work provides guidelines to rationally design pH-responsive microdroplets for smart drug delivery applications.

In this study, first author Harini Mohanram unveiled the 3D structure of the cement protein from the M. rosa barnacle CP20 using solution NMR. Barnacles secrete a strong wet-resistant adhesive and CP20 is a major component of this proteinaceous-cement. The work is significant because it has largely been assumed that such functional adhesive proteins are fully disordered, an assumption challenged by the structural determination of CP20. Indeed, this is the first report describing the tertiary structure of an extracellular biological adhesive protein at the molecular level.

In this study, we have discovered that a short, 8 amino-acid long peptide abundantly present in sucker ring teeth proteins can form stiff hydrogels by simple gelation in water without using any chemical modification or organic solvent. Using solution and solid-state NMR, we have shown that the peptide initially forms unusual right-handed 3<sub>10</sub> helices (which have never been reported before for a short peptide). Gelation occurs by a 3<sub>10</sub> helices to &beta;-sheet conformation transition. The biocompatibility, low immunogenicity as well as ease of gelation in water makes this peptide hydrogel a promising candidate for various biomedical applications.

In this paper entitled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/18/8685" target='_blank'>“A diecast mineralization process forms the tough mantis shrimp dactyl club”</a>, first author Dr. Shahrouz Amini (currently at the Max-Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam, Germany) and colleagues have unveiled the growth of the entire ultra-tough dactyl club of the mantis shrimp, a model system which we have been investigating since 2010. The study exploits the fact that mantis shrimps, as crustaceans, regularly molt their entire exoskeletons (including the dactyl club), providing a unique opportunity to monitor the growth of entire complex hard tissues. Thus, by maintaining live specimens in our aquaria mantis shrimps represent an ideal model organism to study biomineralization. In the study, we also identified the main protein regulating apatite formation in the dactyl club by assembling a transcriptome of the dactyl club tissue and probing it with proteomic data of the macromolecular template that controls the club biomineralization. Congrats to Shahrouz and all other BBML members for this excellent achievement!

                    <p class="card-text">A new paper by BBML, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201808191" target="_blank">“A Double-Layer Mechanochromic Hydrogel with Multidirectional Force Sensing and Encryption Capability”</a> is published in Advanced Functional Materials. The work by Dr. Qingi Zhu was in close collaboration with Profs. Prof. Niels Holten-Andersen and Krystyn Van Vliet from the Department of Materials Science at MIT. Qingdi developed robust double-layer hydrogels that display remarkable mechanochromic ability over a wide range of strain up to 300% deformation. The hydrogel is based on a double-layer concept, with each layer containing luminescent species (lanthanide ions and carbon dots) exhibiting overlapped absorption spectra but distinct emission spectra. The work also demonstrates proof-of-concept applications of the hydrogel as pressure and contact force sensors as well as its potential to be used for encryption devices

In this work, first author Maryam Tadayon from our lab has demonstrated how the saddle of the mantis shrimp dactyl club can store a high density of elastic energy in order to power the ultra-fast strike of the dactyl club. The saddle is a bi-layer structure, with one layer ceramic-based to store a high density of elastic energy and the other layer containing a higher content of biopolymers to prevent brittle fracture of the saddle. The paper was featured, among others, in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/funky-materials-give-the-mantis-shrimp-its-powerful-punch/" target="_blank">Wired Magazine</a>, <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/we-now-know-the-mechanism-behind-the-mantis-shrimps-powerful-punch/" target="_blank">iflscience</a>; and <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/ceramicpolymer-combination-gives-mantis-shrimp-its-incredible-punching-power-/3009654.article" target="_blank">Chemistry World</a>.

                    <p class="card-text">Two publications from BBML were recently published. In their <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/BM/C8BM00556G#!divAbstract" target="_blank">paper Supramolecular propensity of suckerin proteins is driven by β-sheets and aromatic interactions</a> published in “Biomaterials Science”, Dr. Akshita Kumar and Dr. Harini Mohanram have precisely demonstrated using protein NMR which domains of suckerin proteins (previously discovered and sequenced in our lab) adopt anti-parallel beta-sheets. They have also shown that suckerins are further stabilized by pi-pi stacking of aromatic residues, providing design guidelines to artificially produce suckerin-like proteins exhibiting similar mechanical properties. And in his paper <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00369" target="_blank">Glucose-Responsive Peptide Coacervates with High Encapsulation Efficiency for Controlled Release of Insulin</a> published in “Bioconjugate Chemistry”, Zhi Wei Lim has exploited modular peptides from squid beak proteins (previously discovered and sequenced in our lab) to produce coacervate micro-droplets that can encapsulate both insulin and glucose oxidase with extreme high efficiency, with a very simple coacervation process. The micro-droplets are pH sensitive: upon exposure to glucose, glucose oxidase transforms glucose into gluconic acid, thereby locally decreasing pH and triggering the disassembly of micro-droplets and the release of insulin. Therefore, the micro-droplets mimic this glucose responsiveness function of pancreatic β-cell by releasing insulin according to glucose levels. Congrats all for these great publications.

                    <p class="card-text">Our paper entitled <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151028/ncomms9737/full/ncomms9737.html">“Mussel adhesion is dictated by time-regulated secretion and molecular conformation of mussel adhesive proteins”</a> appeared today in <i>“Nature Communications”</i>. In this work, we have shown that adhesive proteins secreted by the green mussel to stick to solid substrates is precisely orchestrated, with the the protein Pvfp-5 always secreted first and playing the role as a primer that removes surface water for subsequent tight adhesion. We have also obtained for the first time the tertiary structure of mussel adhesive proteins by homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. Members of BBML on this work were first-author Luigi Petrone, co-authors Akshita Kumar, Clarinda Sutanto, Shahrouz Amini, and corresponding author Ali Miserez. This work was a close collaboration with the groups of Chandra Verma at the Bioinformatics Institute at A*Star and Dr. Bruno Zappone from the Italian National Research Council.

                    <p class="card-text">A manuscript entitled <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150921/ncomms9313/full/ncomms9313.html">"Multi-scale thermal stability of a hard thermoplastic protein-based material"</a> co-led by the BBML and by Dr. Admir Masic from the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces appeared today in <i>“Nature Communications”</i>. In this work, we have demonstrated for the first time the potential of the “Squid Sucker Ring Teeth (SRT)” –previously discovered in our lab– to be used as a thermoplastic biopolymer for 3D printing applications. A unique property of SRT is their fully thermo-plastic behaviour, a characteristic which is very uncommon in biopolymers. In collaboration with our colleagues from the Wyss Institute for Bioinspired Engineering at Harvard (James Weaver) and the MIT media lab (Steven Keating and Neri Oxman), we have demonstrated that SRT can be used a recylable biopolymer that can be re-used multiple times during additive manufacturing. We have also elucidated the fundamental structural features, across multiple length scales, responsible for the thermoplastic behaviour of SRT using temperature resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering, Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The work opens up many interesting possibilities to develop SRT-based biopolymers as eco-friendly materials in additive manufacturing applications.

                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Publications</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">Two papers from the BBML are appearing on-line today, one in <i>"Nature Materials"</i> and one in <i>Nature Chemical Biology</i>. In the paper appearing in <i>"Nature Materials"</i>, entitled <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat4309.html">“The role of quasi-plasticity in the extreme contact damage tolerance of the stomatopod dactyl club"</a>, authored by Shahrouz Amini, Maryam Tadayon, and Ali Miserez from the BBML and Prof. Sridhar Idapalapati from MAE, we have unveiled key mechanisms that endow mantis shrimps’ dactyl clubs with their remarkable impact damage tolerance. Using comprehensive nano- and micro-contact mechanics studies, combined with Raman spectroscopy, we have shown that the impact surface of dactyl clubs exhibit a quasi-plastic contact mechanics response, which is key in absorbing impact energy. We have also shown that the inner layers of the dactyl club strain-harden under contact load, which further enhances the damage tolerance against impact.

                    <p class="card-text">The second paper appearing today in <i>"Nature Chemical Biology"</i>, entitled <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchembio.1833.html">“Infiltration of chitin by protein coacervates defines the squid beak mechanical gradient"</a> is the result from a close collaboration with the group of Prof. Herb Waite at UCSB (Dr. YerPeng Tan and Dr. Wei Wei) and the Molecular Engineering Lab/A*Star (MEL, Dr. Shawn Hoon), with Paul Guerette, Cai Hao, Ali Ghadban, and Ali Miserez as contributors from the BBML. In this work, we have first sequenced all major beak proteins that make up the robust squid beak. We have shown that the beak is comprised of 2 major protein families, namely Dosidicus gigas Chitin-Binding Proteins (DgCBPs) and D. gigas His-rich Proteins (DgHBPs). Next, we have demonstrated that DgHBPs form so-called “coacervates”, which is key in the bioprocessing of this remarkable graded structure. This study demonstrates for the first time that protein coacervates play a central role during the processing of chitin/protein bulk biocomposites. According to our study, this phenomenon could be more widely spread in Biology than currently recognised, for instance during the formation of insect exoskeletons (cuticles) or in arthropod fangs (spider and scorpion fangs for instance). Congrats to all for these very thorough studies that spanned over a few years before they finally got published!"

                    <p class="card-text">Congratulations to Dawei Ding and other BBML group members (Paul Guerette, Fu Jing, Lihong Zhang) for the publication of his paper entitled <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/adma.201500280/abstract">“From Soft Self-Healing Gels to Stiff Films in Suckerin-Based Materials Through Modulation of Crosslink Density and β-Sheet Content”</a> in <i>"Advanced Materials"</i>. In this work, we have used our recently discovered “suckerin” proteins to prepare biomaterials spanning 7-orders of magnitude of elasticity, from soft hydrogels to very stiff films. We have exploited the unique di-block, co-polymer-like primary structure and Di-Tyrosine cross-linking chemistry to vary the stiffness of suckerin-based materials. We have also shown the excellent biocompatibility of suckerin materials, and this work opens a wide range of possibilities to use suckerins in biomedical applications.

                    <h4 class="card-title">Nanoconfined β‐Sheets Mechanically Reinforce the Supra-Biomolecular Network of Robust Squid Sucker Ring Teeth</h4>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Publications</h6>
                    <p class="card-text">Our paper <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn502149u">“Nanoconfined β‐Sheets Mechanically Reinforce the Supra-Biomolecular Network of Robust Squid Sucker Ring Teeth”</a> is published in <i>"ACS Nano"</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">This work is the culmination of our recent efforts to understand the intriguing sucker ring teeth (SRT), located on the tentacles and arms of cephalopods (squids and cuttlefish). SRT exhibit hard tissues-like mechanical properties, yet are completely non-mineralised and do not contain metal ions either. Instead, they are completely protein-based, and perhaps even more fascinating covalent cross-links between the protein chains are also absent. Thus, SRT are essentially giant supramolecular networks that are thermoplastic-like, a property which is unprecedented in other biological hard tissues and very useful in order to reshape the material at will by simple thermal activation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">The paper main conclusion are three fold. First, we have demonstrated that SRT are made of a protein family –called “suckerins"– with extreme modular design: the entire teeth is a protein complex made of 10 to 20 (depending on the species) highly related proteins, with most of them containing silk-like domains. Second, using a phylogenetic analysis of the modular proteins, we have shown that suckerin are encoded by an ancient gene family which is ~ 350 Millions years old. Third, the work shows that the major contribution to mechanical reinforcement are nanoconfined β-sheets of precise nano-scale dimensions that are optimised for mechanical strengthening. The size of the nanoconfined β-sheets is precisely encoded by the regular placement of Proline residues in suckerin proteins, which act as precise β-sheet breakers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">The work provides an extensive molecular toolbox for molecular biomimcry, using either the full-length suckerin sequences we have discovered or their smaller modular peptidic building blocks that could be exploited in various self-assembly strategies. Collaborators on this work include colleagues at MEL lab/A*STAR (Dr. Shawn Hoon), the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces (Dr. Admir Masic), the Wyss Institute for Bioinspired Engineering at Harvard (Dr. James Weaver), and the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at A*STAR (Dr. Byrappa Venkatesh and Dr. Vydianathan Ravi).

                <p>At the Laboratory for Biological and Biomimetic Materials (BBML), we study biological materials that feature unique properties –or combination of– currently not achieved in man-made materials and that are multifunctional. Our long-term vision is to use synthetic strategies that mimic key structural, biochemical and physico-chemical principles discovered in our model systems.</p>
